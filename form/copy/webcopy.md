Frame the problem
The single biggest problem in any form of communication is the illusion that it has taken place. To an extent, we don't know where? Email reminder, Client Queries on WhatsApp, Team meeting Notes or just passing by a suggestion on the artwork you just created.
Simplifying contextual communication through smarter tools. Tools with infinite capabilities
Bigger Questions
A lot of inspiration are sourced, yet an enterprise level directory is missing.
Every Project spends approx 10%-15% of it's time in review and feedback.
As creative Professional, how do we track time and bill it to the client honestly and Vice-Versa.

Story of bindU video
Product Demo
Story bindu
We start the film with shot of Lookat.io Showreel or website and then to all our competitors website.
Versioning System
bindU releases are each assigned a version number, such as "v0.25.2", in the format v<phase>.<feature>.<patch>. A change only in the patch number indicates a fairly minor release that mainly contains fixes and therefore is very unlikely to cause breakages upon update. A change in the feature number indicates a release which will generally bring new features in addition to fixes and enhancements. These releases have a small chance of introducing breaking changes upon update so it's worth checking for any notes in the update guide. A change in the phase indicates a much large change in bindU that will likely incur breakages requiring manual intervention. We are just kidding.
Each bindU release will have a milestone created with issues & pull requests assigned to it to define what will be in that release. Milestones are built up then worked through until complete at which point, after some testing and documentation updates, the release will be deployed.
For feature releases, and some patch releases, the release will be accompanied by a post on the bindU blog which will provide additional detail on features, changes & updates otherwise the GitHub release page will show a list of changes. You can sign up to be alerted to new bindU blogs posts (once per week maximum) at this link.

Frame the problem
The single biggest problem in any form of communication is the illusion that it has taken place. To an extent, we don't know where? Email reminder, Client Queries on WhatsApp, Team meeting Notes or just passing by a suggestion on the artwork you just created.
Simplifying contextual communication through smarter tools. Tools with infinite capabilities
Bigger Questions
A lot of inspiration are sourced, yet an enterprise level directory is missing.
Every Project spends approx 10%-15% of it's time in review and feedback.
As creative Professional, how do we track time and bill it to the client honestly and Vice-Versa.

Documentation
Versioning System
bindU releases are each assigned a version number, such as "v0.25.2", in the format v<phase>.<feature>.<patch>. A change only in the patch number indicates a fairly minor release that mainly contains fixes and therefore is very unlikely to cause breakages upon update. A change in the feature number indicates a release which will generally bring new features in addition to fixes and enhancements. These releases have a small chance of introducing breaking changes upon update so it's worth checking for any notes in the update guide. A change in the phase indicates a much large change in bindU that will likely incur breakages requiring manual intervention. We are just kidding.
Each bindU release will have a milestone created with issues & pull requests assigned to it to define what will be in that release. Milestones are built up then worked through until complete at which point, after some testing and documentation updates, the release will be deployed.
For feature releases, and some patch releases, the release will be accompanied by a post on the bindU blog which will provide additional detail on features, changes & updates otherwise the GitHub release page will show a list of changes. You can sign up to be alerted to new bindU blogs posts (once per week maximum) at this link.
